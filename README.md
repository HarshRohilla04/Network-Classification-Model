- **Problem Statement:** 
Problem Statement #8
Classify User Application Traffic at the Network in a Multi-UE Connected Scenario
Applications are affected differently under varying traffic conditions, channel states, and 
coverage scenarios. If the traffic of each UE can be categorized into broader categories, such as 
Video Streaming, Audio Calls, Video Calls, Gaming, Video Uploads, browsing, texting etc. that 
can enable the Network to serve a differentiated and curated QoS for each type of traffic. Develop 
an AI model to analyze a traffic pattern and predict the application category with high accuracy.
